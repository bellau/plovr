# Script that is designed to run plovr "unpacked."
#
# IMPORTANT: `ant compile` must be run once before running this script.
#
# Running `ant compile` does three important things:
#
# (1) It generates files, such as the .java files generated from Soy's grammar.
# (2) It copies static resources, such as externs, to the place where Ant
#     later expects them so it can put them in a JAR file.
# (3) It compiles .java files to .class files.
#
# In the steady-state of plovr development, the inputs to (1) and (2) do not
# change very often, so it is wasteful to do them every time `ant compile` is
# run. Unfortunately, Ant does not know any better, so it always performs
# these expensive steps.
#
# The main thing that we are interested in is modifying .java files and then
# re-running plovr with these new changes. Eclipse is configured to write
# its .class files to build/classes, just as Ant is, so its incremental
# compilation will generate .class files to the right place.
#
# From here, we can run "unpacked," i.e., not from plovr.jar, so long as
# the .class files in build/classes/ can read resources from disk just as
# they could if they were in plovr.jar. In this way, for most changes to
# plovr, we can modify code in Eclipse and then re-run this script, which
# is much faster than invoking `ant jar` between each change.
